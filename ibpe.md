<h1>Interactive BPE tokenizer (IBPE)</h1>



<h2>Project summary</h2>

The aim of this project is to develop a web-based interface for a custom text tokenizer, similar to the [ChatGPT interactive tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer). Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The BPE tokenizer is a subword tokenisation algorithm that splits words into smaller subword units based on their frequency in a given text corpus. For instance, the word "unhappiness" might be tokenized into "un", "happi", and "ness". This approach is useful for handling rare words and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into more common subwords. In this project, students will develop a web interface that allows users to upload a text file to create a custom BPE tokenizer. The subword frequencies for BPE will be stored in a database. Users will be able to input text to see the tokenization output, similar to the ChatGPT tokenizer. This project will provide a platform for students to experiment with the impact of tokenization on various text corpora, offering hands-on experience with a fundamental NLP technique.
