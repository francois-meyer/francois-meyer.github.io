I am a Lecturer (≈ US Assistant Professor) at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/depts/science) of the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and part of the [UCT NLP research group](https://www.janmbuys.com/uctnlp/index.html). 

My current research is on low-resource NLP, data-efficient modelling, and linguistically informed interpretability. I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of two areas where data efficiency is central: NLP for low-resource languages and developmentally plausible NLP.

I completed my PhD under [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/) at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. My [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8OkDD5ayzPLFmElDL09CdUTVqPMj_VH/view?usp=sharing) was on optimising subword segmentation for low-resource, morphologically complex languages. Previously I obtained a [masters in AI](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/), and my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/).

<h2>News</h2>

<b>October 2025</b>

* Our paper [The Learning Dynamics of Subword Segmentation for Morphologically Diverse Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09197) is accepted to AACL. I will be in Mumbai in December to present it.

* We released [BabyBabelLM: A Multilingual Benchmark of Developmentally Plausible Training Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10159) [\[website\]](https://babylm.github.io/babybabellm/). I was responsible for curating the datasets for five South African languages: isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sesotho, Sepedi, and Afrikaans.
