I am a Lecturer (â‰ˆ US Assistant Professor) at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/depts/science) of the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and a researcher in [UCT NLP](https://www.janmbuys.com/uctnlp/index.html). I recently finished [my PhD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8OkDD5ayzPLFmElDL09CdUTVqPMj_VH/view?usp=sharing) under [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/). My project was on subword-optimised neural text generation (language modelling, MT, data-to-text) for low-resource, morphologically complex languages. 

My broader research interests are in low-resource NLP, data-efficient modelling, and linguistically informed interpretability.

Previously I completed my [masters in AI](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/). Before that
I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/) in South Africa.
