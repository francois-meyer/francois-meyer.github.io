I am a Lecturer (≈ US Assistant Professor) at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/depts/science) of the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/) and part of the [UCT NLP research group](https://www.janmbuys.com/uctnlp/index.html). 

My current research is on low-resource NLP, data-efficient modelling, and linguistically informed interpretability. I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of two areas where data efficiency is central: NLP for low-resource languages and developmentally plausible NLP.

I completed my PhD under [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/) at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. My [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8OkDD5ayzPLFmElDL09CdUTVqPMj_VH/view?usp=sharing) was on optimising subword segmentation for low-resource, morphologically complex languages. Previously I obtained a [masters in AI](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/), and my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/).

<h2>News</h2>

<b>February 2026</b> I will be at EACL in Morocco to give an invited talk titled "Data-Efficient Language Modelling for Low-Resource Languages" at the [AfricaNLP workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/africanlp2026). 

<b>January 2026</b> [BabyBabelLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10159)  (+ [project website](https://babylm.github.io/babybabellm/)) is accepted to EACL. This was multi-continent collaboration to produce a benchmark of developmentally plausible data for 45 languages. I was responsible for five South African languages: isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sesotho, Sepedi, and Afrikaans.



<b>December 2025</b> I attended AACL in Mumbai to present our paper [*The Learning Dynamics of Subword Segmentation for Morphologically Diverse Languages*](https://aclanthology.org/2025.ijcnlp-long.36.pdf).


<b>May 2025</b> My students and collaborators presented a few workhops papers at NAACL and ACL.
