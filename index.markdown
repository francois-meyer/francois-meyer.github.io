I am a PhD student at the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/), working under the supervision of [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/depts/science)	 and the [HPI Research School](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/research/hpi). 
My project is about text generation for low-resources languages. I am designing neural language models that learn more efficiently by modelling language at the morphological level.

Previously I completed my [masters in AI](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). For my thesis, supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/), I designed neural methods that learn density matrices for words within the categorical compositional distributional ([DisCoCat](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/categorical+compositional+distributional+semantics)) framework. Before that
I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/) in South Africa.

My broad research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in investigating whether deep neural networks can learn and use linguistic concepts like morphology, syntax, and compositionality.
