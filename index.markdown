I am a PhD candidate and Lecturer (â‰ˆ Assistant Professor) at the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/), working under [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/depts/science). 
My project is about text generation (language modelling, machine translation, data-to-text) for low-resource, morphologically complex languages. I am developing subword-driven neural architectures to model the agglutinative morphology of the Nguni languages of South Africa.

My broader research interests are in linguistically informed NLP interpretability. I am particularly interested in investigating whether deep neural networks can learn and use concepts like morphology, syntax, and compositionality.

Previously I completed my [masters in AI](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/study-programme.html) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/). Before that
I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.cs.sun.ac.za/) in South Africa.
