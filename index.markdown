I am a PhD student at the University of Cape Town, under the supervision of [Jan Buys](http://www.janmbuys.com/) in the Computer Science Department. 
My project is about text generation for low-resources languages. I am designing neural language models that learn more efficiently by modelling language at the morphological level.

My broader research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in investigating whether deep neural networks can learn and use concepts like morphology, syntax, and compositionality.


Previously I completed my masters in AI at the University of Amsterdam. For my thesis, supervised by [Martha Lewis](https://marthaflinderslewis.wordpress.com/), I designed neural methods for learning density matrices for words within the categorical compositional distributional (DisCoCat) framework. Before that
I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics at Stellenbosch University.
